# SportsBook
A sports data scraping and analysis tool

This project is in its very early days. The Python script currently gives the user the option to select a league (or multiple leagues) to load, view the loaded leagues, export it/them to a json file and import a previously exported json file.

The menu system in place works but is not properly organised
There's no other functionality added yet.
The code isn't pretty and the functions aren't being used in a typical way.
The code isn't well commented.

Do next:

Tidy the code.
Fix functions so that they flow more naturally.
Implement a decent menu system.
Create a function that gives the option to select the "home team" and the "away team" from the chosen leagues.
Create a function that produces a comparison based on the home team and away team passed to it and makes selections based on different rules.
Create a scraper function that scrapes upcoming fixtures for the selected leagues.
Create a function that passes the scraped fixtures into the comparison function .
Create a menu system to manage all of the above.
Implement a system to scrape results, evaluate selection methods, and display a comparison.
