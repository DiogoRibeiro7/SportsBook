# SportsBook
A sports data scraping and analysis tool

This project is in its very early days and currently only supports football (soccer). The Python script currently gives the user the option to select a league (or multiple leagues) to load, view the loaded leagues, export it/them to a json file and import a previously exported json file.

When complete, the user will be able to select a sport and a league or competition. They'll then be able to view stats, build comparisons, review fixtures and generate reports.

Read the wiki to see the latest ews and progress.

It'd be great to hear from you so please leave a comment.
